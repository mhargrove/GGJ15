This is Mike. He is in his final semester of college and his exams are almost upon him. 
With only a week's worth of time, Mike needs to start studying.
Unfortunately he cannot study on his own since... well... he's as lazy as they come.
Together, can you lead Mike to success, or will you be his downfall...
